<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-family: monospace; background-color: wheat;">Spain, a country on Europe’s Iberian Peninsula, includes 17 autonomous regions with diverse geography and cultures. Capital city Madrid is home to the Royal Palace and Prado museum, housing works by European masters. Segovia has a medieval castle (the Alcázar) and an intact Roman aqueduct. Catalonia’s capital, Barcelona, is defined by Antoni Gaudí’s whimsical modernist landmarks like the Sagrada Família church. Spain is located in south-western Europe, on the Iberian Peninsula which it shares with Portugal. It’s a popular travel destination for Europeans who pack the country’s beach resorts in summer. From the Costa del Sol to the Canary Islands of Tenerife and Lanzarote, and the Balearics of Ibiza and Majorca, there’s a lot of choice!
  <br>

But there’s more to Spain than simple beach holidays. The country offers a wealth of city break destinations, from the capital Madrid to Barcelona, Seville and Bilbao in the north. And there is a rich cultural history to uncover. This includes an Islamic history in the south, crowned by the Alhambra complex in Granada and the mosque-cathedral of Cordoba. </p>
