<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-family: monospace; background-color: wheat;">Switzerland is a mountainous Central European country, home to numerous lakes, villages and the high peaks of the Alps. Its cities contain medieval quarters, with landmarks like capital Bern’s Zytglogge clock tower and Lucerne’s wooden chapel bridge. The country is also known for its ski resorts and hiking trails. Banking and finance are key industries, and Swiss watches and chocolate are world renowned. There really is no shying away from adventure in Switzerland. Sky-high mountains, glinting glaciers, emerald lakes and epic train journeys – it’s everywhere you look, effectively making this multilingual country Europe’s prime adventure playground. In the south, Zermatt ski resort brims with cozy chalets beneath the towering hulk of 4,478-metre-high Matterhorn Mountain. Glide down the well-groomed pistes, or treat yourself to some off-piste tree runs – snow conditions here are rarely anything but perfect. <br>Meanwhile, the frozen surface of Lake St. Moritz, to the east, plays host to unusual sports like skijoring, ice cricket and ‘White Turf’ horse racing. Come summer, snow and ice give way to shimmering lakes and great, green forests. It’s best appreciated in Interlaken, either from the 1,300-metre-high Harder Klum observation deck, or with a thrilling tandem paragliding experience through the valley. Alternatively, take a ride on an old-time steamboat to capture fairytale views of the fishing villages, farmhouses and hilltop fortresses either side of this central destination. All this rural beauty combines with a variety of captivating cities – capital Bern with its medieval old town, Germanic Basel and its head-turning architecture, chic Geneva and its taste for luxury, and sprawling Zürich with its artsy edge, riverside bars and fondue restaurants. There’s no shortage of accommodation options in Switzerland, with an abundance of hotels to choose from, plus many lodges, chalets and lakeview apartments available to rent throughout the country.</p>
