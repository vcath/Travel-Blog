<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-family: monospace; background-color: wheat;">Thailand is a Southeast Asian country. It's known for tropical beaches, opulent royal palaces, ancient ruins and ornate temples displaying figures of Buddha. In Bangkok, the capital, an ultramodern cityscape rises next to quiet canalside communities and the iconic temples of Wat Arun, Wat Pho and the Emerald Buddha Temple (Wat Phra Kaew). Nearby beach resorts include bustling Pattaya and fashionable Hua Hin. Bangkok is a modern world metropolis, which you can start exploring from above by ascending to the top of one of the many skyscrapers. You can get a free drink at the top of one of the tallest buildings, which belongs to the Baiyoke Sky Hotel, by taking advantage of this offer.<br> Of course, the list of attractions in Bangkok doesn’t end here. You can continue exploring the city by visiting the Temple of the Emerald Buddha and the most famous royal palace in the city where you’ll discover Bangkok’s cultural and historical heritage. You’ll be accompanied by an English guide. The tour includes a visit to the Wat Pho temple with its famous Reclining Buddha, where you can feel the greatness of the mysterious being. If you’re looking for some fun, you can take a walk along the Khao San Road. And if you want to experience the hidden Bangkok you should go on a three-hour bicycle tour, which will take you through the largest Chinatown in the world and across Thailand’s main river, the Chao Phraya.</p>
