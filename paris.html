<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px; font-family: monospace; background-color: wheat;">Paris, France's capital, is a major European city and a global center for art, fashion, gastronomy and culture. Its 19th-century cityscape is crisscrossed by wide boulevards and the River Seine. Beyond such landmarks as the Eiffel Tower and the 12th-century, Gothic Notre-Dame cathedral, the city is known for its cafe culture and designer boutiques along the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honor√©. <br>Located in the north-central part of France on the river Seine, Paris is the country's cosmopolitan capital. "The City of Love," as people call it, is said to be one of the most beautiful and romantic cities brimming with culture, art, fashion, food, and history. Home to some of the most popular iconic monuments and museums, Paris consists of a large part along the Seine designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
